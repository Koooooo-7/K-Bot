## ðŸ“£Introduction

>  A DIY bot that you can be the designer of your own **`K-bot`** â€‹!:fire:

**`K-bot`** is a Quantum [Discord](discord.com) bot, which means she can do everything, if she has enough plugins. :rocket:

It is **NOT** the specific bot which is just for importing to your Discord server( absolutely, she can do that ! :wink: ).



**`K-bot`** is developed in `SpringBoot` and makes all the plugins as plugins/configurations.  hence you can chose what skills you want for `K-bot` via setting the configuration files to summon the abilities, and you can add and register your own plugins in **`K-bot`** easily. :cowboy_hat_face: 



---

## :book:Usage

> IF YOU WANNA USE IT.

Set those configurations to `application.yml`(more details in `application-example.yml`).

**Get your bot**

```yaml
k-bot:
  # your bot token
  token: "your bot token"
  # the command you wanna call your bot
  cmd: "!koy"
```

**Summon  Plugin**

the plugins you want add to your bot and then , it will only create those plugin instances.

```yaml
  # register plugins
  plugins:
  - player
  - time
  - joker
```



> IF YOU WANNA CREATE IT !

**Create Plugin**

- Implementation interface.

the parser will give the arguments to your plugin if it matched.

```java
public interface IPlugin {
    
    void handle(String[] args);
    
    @Deprecated
    String command();
}
```



- Define command

We use the  annotation `@Plugin` to define the plugin meta data.

```java
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Inherited
public @interface Plugin {

    // the plugin name
    String name() default "";

    // how to call the plugin normally
    String call();

    // fast commands
    String[] fastCommand() default {};
}
```



- Configure the condition

We won't create the plugin instance when it does not be called, so we should set the conditional configuration.

```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnSummoned(name = "k-bot.plugins", havingValue = "player")
public AudioPlayer audioPlayer(){
    return new AudioPlayer();
}
```

**Example**

the example of how to create the plugin `joker`.

- create `joker`

```java
@Plugin(name = "joker", call = "joker", fastCommand = {"j", "jk"})
public class Joker implements IPlugin {
    ...
}
```

- set bean condition

```java
@Bean
@ConditionalOnSummoned(name = "k-bot.plugins", havingValue = "joker")
public Joker joker() {
    return new Joker();
}
```

it is so easy to add an new plugin to `K-bot`, isn't it ! :tada:
