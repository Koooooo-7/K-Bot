## 📣Introduction

**Kbot** is a Quantum Discord which means she can do everything if she has enough plugins&equipments. 

She is made in SpringBoot and makes all the plugins as plugins/configurations.  hence you can chose what skills you want for kbot via setting the configuration files to summon the abilities, and you can register your own plugins easyliy. Besides that, you can give her your own calling name/command !
